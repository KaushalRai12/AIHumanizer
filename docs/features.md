    D --> H[5,000 credits/month]
    D --> D1[Advanced features]
    E --> I[Unlimited credits]
    E --> E1[All features + API access]
```

## Credit System
Each subscription tier comes with a specific number of credits. Credits are consumed based on the length of the text being humanized.

| Text Length | Credits Used |
|-------------|--------------|
| 0-500 chars | 1 credit     |
| 501-1000 chars | 2 credits |
| 1001-2000 chars | 4 credits |
| 2001-5000 chars | 10 credits |
| 5001+ chars | 20 credits |

## Undetectable AI Integration
The Text Humanizer feature integrates with the Undetectable AI API to provide high-quality AI text humanization. The integration works as follows:

1. User inputs text in the humanizer interface
2. Frontend sends the text to our backend API
3. Backend makes a request to Undetectable AI with the appropriate parameters
4. Undetectable AI processes the text and returns humanized version
5. Backend saves both original and humanized versions to the database
6. Backend updates the user's credit balance
7. Frontend displays the humanized text to the user

### API Implementation
```javascript
// Example of Undetectable AI API integration
async function humanizeText(text, level = 'moderate') {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.undetectable.ai/humanize', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.UNDETECTABLE_API_KEY}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text,
      humanization_level: level
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
